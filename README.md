42 school `ft_ls` project.

**Disclaimer: This project was developped for a purely pedagogic purpose. It is not meant to replace your system's ls command.**

---

## Summary

A partial rewriting of [GNU coreutils's ls command](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/ls-invocation.html#ls-invocation) written in c for linux.

*The objective of this project was to learn the different type of files and their attributes in a filesystem.
Because of the amount of data to display and the option to list subdirectories recursively, a well-thought code structure was primordial.*
